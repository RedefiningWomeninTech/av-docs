## Use Case

There is a single source for audio and video. This could be a presentation or interview. The audio and video source  will likely not change while streaming to a service like facebook or youtube.

## Set Up

* Camera
* SlingStudio

Since this is a single person the camera mic will likely be enough. SlingStuidio will strem to the service of your choise.
The iOS or Android device will run the StreamStudio mobile application to manage the StreamStudio hub.
